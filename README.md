SpreeLegacyData
===============

This is a Spree extension to assist with managing legacy data, perhaps after migrating from a different e-commerce platform.

Currently it adds only a TaxonMapping class. This is intended to be used to help redirect legacy traffic to the correct place in Spree.

Installation
------------

Add spree_legacy_data to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_legacy_data'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_legacy_data:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```
